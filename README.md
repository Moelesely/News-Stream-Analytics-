Project description: 
A real-time data pipeline that extracts insights from news content through web scraping, streaming, and natural language processing.

📋 Overview
News Stream Analytics is a comprehensive data engineering project that demonstrates how to build an end-to-end pipeline for collecting, 
processing, and analyzing news articles in real-time. This project showcases modern data engineering practices and technologies in a containerized environment.

✨ Key Features

Real-time Web Scraping: Automatically collects news articles from major German and international sources (BBC, Bild, Reuters)

Stream Processing: Utilizes Apache Kafka for scalable message handling and real-time data streaming

Text Analysis: Applies NLP techniques for sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and entity recognition

Containerized Architecture: Employs Docker and docker-compose for easy deployment and scaling

Data Persistence: Stores processed articles and analytical results in PostgreSQL database

Modular Design: Features a clean, maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns


Data Flow

Collection: Web scrapers collect articles from international news websites

Ingestion: Raw articles are pushed to Kafka

Processing: Article text is cleaned and normalized
Sentiment analysis is performed
Named entities are extracted
Keywords are identified


Storage: Processed articles and analytical results are stored in PostgreSQL

Analysis: Insights can be queried from the database
